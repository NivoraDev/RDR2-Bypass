NitroCore private server can be described as an independent online system that bypasses Rockstar’s official RDR2 servers, offering players an alternative environment. Instead of relying on Rockstar’s anti-cheat, NitroCore implements its own protection system: if a cheater is detected, they are immediately auto-banned. This makes it a safe private server for players who are frustrated with the constant presence of cheaters on official RDR2 Online servers. In addition, such private servers allow customization, roleplay, and community-driven rules without affecting Rockstar’s ecosystem
